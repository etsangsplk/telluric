# telluric
a decentralized, paranoid, fluid network

quite arcane

## network
> follow the current

the telluric network uses induction, incremental establishment of trust and preference, to build its routes and deliver you to your destination

routing is fully decentralized, and connections are made and maintained despite nodes only knowing their neighbours

hosts are identified by simple names, which the network learns and begins to trust over time

users seek out hosts by way of an interface, a node temporarily converted into a point of leverage into the routing system

communication is made difficult to observe through the use of a powerful geometric construction, vaguely resembling cryptography

the network has many uses, but its mind is focused on streaming communication, for which it grows to optimize

## machine
> a step backwards

the telluric client is a virtual machine architected for network applications

it allows for very easy development of simple programs with simple interfaces, and frustrates the development of complex ones

it provides a character-grid display with extended drawing capability, simple audio i/o, and abstracted networking

it runs multiple applications simultaneously, each confined to a tab, and isolated from each other

the binary size, memory usage, and storage capability of applications are highly restricted

the client makes no attempt to reproduce the decadence of the web, and occupies a far more limited niche

## language
> a lost art

the telluric vm instruction set is designed to be written directly, and has a programmer-friendly assembler

it is patterned after traditional machine architectures, with a high level of abstraction and a few unusual facilities

primary emphasis is on concision, many operations are macro-like and provided for program size optimization

it is fully documented in [doc/isa.md](doc/isa)
